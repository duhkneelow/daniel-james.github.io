## Possible Career?
<img class="ui small right floated image" src="../images/software-code.jpg">
To be completely honest, I knew I wanted to be in the computer science field ever since I developed a habit of being on the computer for a extremely long period of time. The time that I spent involved with an interesting range of topics from playing computer games at a bunch of different websites to doing research of some of the most random facts popping right out of my head.  I am fortunate enough that I was able to harness that energy and ambition stemming back from my child to a college path that could enhance my skill set.  Hopefully with that path, it could be a reality that I would be satisfied no matter how many hardships there will be.  Although I do want a career within computer science, I am completely unsure where my niche is in this field.

## Breaking those Bad Habits
Despite the fact that I have had a bit of experience with programming languages mostly associated with web design/development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), obviously my knowledge/skills have become rusty since it has been a while I have dabbled with them due to lack of motivation.  Aside from that, even though I am thankful to be participating in the software engineering class in the Fall 2020 semester and learning new concepts with the JavaScript exercises, I know I could do better in that class if I stop getting distracted with my computer, mainly YouTube.  I find it very ironic that my computer prohibits me on finishing my work early since majority (if not, all) of my assignments are on the computer.  Hopefully when the semester progresses (and most importantly, after this essay), I can break the bad habits I have and truthfully comprehend with the concepts of what I am learning so that I can have an experience, or better yet, a career that is valuable. 

## Expectations with Software Engineering
Throughout the remainder of this semester, I want to make progress and familiarize myself once more with the programming languages we are going to learn.  Besides breaking my bad habits, it seems I also have to become a quick thinker, especially with the difficult problems, if I want to consider a career in software engineering.  I genuinely hope that I can gain a newfound confidence in this field so that I can help others with the knowledge I know I can hone.  As of now, I am currently enjoying on what I am learning even though it is challenging for me to understand these concepts nowadays.
