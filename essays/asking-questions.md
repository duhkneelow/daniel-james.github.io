Potential candidates in the computer science/technology field are definitely hesitant on coming up with questions as a way for them to master a programming language or a concept they have been comprehending for a while.  In order to ask smartly, thinking smartly and attempting that assignment as many times as you can is the best approach prior to reaching out for a reliable resource.  If you call it quits too easily, you could be fortunate enough to receive a response that solves your situation, but you may not recall as the days go by.  However, there are people who respond with blunt sayings such as “RTFM” and “STFW”, assuming the person who is asking that simple question has an IQ of a peanut.  Also, there are answers in the internet based on assignment question(s) you are struggling with, but changing a few words or typing/writing the answer verbatim from that source is absolutely NOT the way to go since it not only might be the reason for asking stupid questions, but it may also jeopardize your academic standing or worst case, suspension/expulsion.  Asking smart questions indicate and positively impact your work ethic and skill set as a way to become a reliable resource to others.

## How to Ask a Smart Question?

If you want to become the person who asks smart questions, definitely read the essay called [“How to Ask Questions the Smart Way”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond.  He discusses and highlights the fundamental guidelines on interrogating smartly to communities in an interactive environment such as StackOverflow.  The guidelines Raymond mentioned are listed as a criteria on how to ask questions the smart way with proper etiquette.  For this essay, two questions will be exemplified, one as a “smart” question and the other as a ”stupid” question.

## [Smart Question Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146094/why-should-i-use-a-pointer-rather-than-the-object-itself)

In the “smart” question example, the user, gEdringer, simply asked “Why should I use a pointer rather than the object itself?”.  Although it may be considered simple to some computer science candidates, others may have a hard time grasping concepts like a C++ pointer.  The user followed significant guidelines from Eric Raymond’s essay such as writing in clear, grammatical language without any spelling errors and making sure that the question is easy to reply.  Although the user is assuming what the answer might be, it seems he at least did some research, but still is unsure of how using a pointer is better than the object itself.  The user also provided snippets of C++ coding as a way to compare the other lines of code wondering how the first snippet of code is a lot more convenient than the other snippets.

## [Stupid Question Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31152881/i-need-help-understanding-stylesheets)

Despite professors/experts telling students to not to be afraid to ask any questions, unfortunately there is such a thing as a stupid question.  In this “stupid” question example, the user jay165 does not even start off the topic with a question, but with a command saying, “I need help understanding stylesheets”.  According to Raymond’s essay, subject headers are suppose have a meaning that catches an expert’s attention and not showcase how desperate a person is.  Despite the user providing some code, he said that it was for a homework assignment, but it was ungraded.  Since it was for his homework, he could have easily depended on helpful internet resources, books, and/or instructors as opposed to wasting his time and publishing his command on the internet.
