Throughout this past week, our class has been introduced to coding standards and all I can say is it has helped me improve on how I code.  When people think of coding, they think of indentation, creating new lines, and/or putting curly brackets, but it is a lot more than that.  I believe implementing coding standards is highly effective for any potential candidate in the technology field since it can actually help you learn a programming language in a matter of time.  I also believe they can be very useful when handling a homework assignment by yourself or a group project.  As long as you utilize coding standards habitually, there will be signs of progression as the weeks go by.

## Progressing with Coding Standards
To me, the beauty with coding standards is it not only helps you find problems within your code, but it also helps you to make sure your code is legible.  After looking back at the code that I did within JSFiddle and my past coding assignments from other classes, I will have to admit that I definitely did not follow some (if not, most) of the coding standards we were taught.  Thankfully, I want to say that I am getting better at it even though I do believe I still have some work to do.  Hopefully, I can use these set of coding standards on an everyday basis as a way for me to progress with my skills of coding.

## My Relationship with ESLint

Despite me sometimes forgetting to install ESLint to my exercises, I can honestly say I am grateful with ESLint since it detects any bit of JavaScript code that it deems as problematic.  Even though I have a bit of a tougher time comprehending on what we are learning in JavaScript, I enjoy how ESLint simplifies the wrongdoings of my code as it takes me a few seconds to understand what I am doing wrong.  To others, it may take a few minutes, which is OK, because it can be a time-consuming process.  Although I panic a bit that I have a few problems in my code (the red x), I do like it how ESLint inspects my code every time I type and ensures I am implementing the right code.  When I eventually fix every problem, it is satisfying to see the green checkmark, indicating my code is fine.

## Conclusion
As of now, I am enjoying the fundamentals of coding standards even though for some it can be laborious to figure out.  For those who plan to take ICS 314 in an upcoming semester, definitely delve with ESLint in advance to improve your coding quality, and most definitely, your understanding of a programming language.  Implementing them means you are either a skillful asset on a specific programming language or a reliable resource in a project.  Therefore, I believe coding starts are efficient.
