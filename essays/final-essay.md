## Gaining Lessons (And Hopefully Not Weight)

Have you ever had scrumptious, five star-worthy food at a restaurant?  Starting with an appetizer you enjoyed so much to the point where you eventually get infatuated by it, slowing down on a mouthwatering main course to savor those last morsels, and ending on a decadent dessert to the point you cannot stop thinking about it.  Not only does it make you want to go back to the restaurant an endless amount of times, but it also educates your palate in a way you plan to replicate those dishes with nearly perfect execution.  That is exactly how I am feeling during these few bites of software engineering as it comes to an end, which I do not want to happen at all.  And I hopefully will not let it end since I enjoyed it!

When I registered for this class, I genuinely had no idea what I was learning during these harsh times courtesy of the COVID pandemic.  However, as the semester progressed, it started to grow on me just like how a person can have an anathema with stinky cheese, but eventually like it.  From the ever so (formerly) daunting Thursday WODs to the intense group final project, you can say I had an exhilarating trip to Software Engineering Flavortown.  On that trip, I am giving you a tour on some of my favorite topics we have discussed.

## Keeping it Simple with Functional Programming

Most of us have those moments when we are given only a few items and you have absolutely no idea what to do with them.  That was my relationship with Functional Programming because I initially had a difficult time understanding the topic.  However, when I took a couple of glances at the [Underscore Library](http://underscorejs.org/), it dawned on me how it is similar to making pasta or utilizing vegetables and its scraps to condense into a broth.  They both correlate with Functional Programming as they require minimal ingredients, yet they produce simplistically flavorful food that would satisfy customers.  Morally, just because you are given simple ingredients, does not necessarily mean you have to make boring food.  You sometimes just have to follow the KISS principle (Keep It SImple, Stupid) without any built-in objects.  Now I must say I have not fully comprehended this topic yet, but with a few ingredients, I can become a properly seasoned candidate for software engineering.

## Coding Standards and Food
