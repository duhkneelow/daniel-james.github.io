## Gaining Lessons (And Hopefully Not Weight)
<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/full.jpg">
Have you ever had scrumptious, five star-worthy food at a restaurant?  Starting with an appetizer you enjoyed so much to the point where you eventually get infatuated by it, slowing down on a mouthwatering main course to savor those last morsels, and ending on a decadent dessert to the point you cannot stop thinking about it.  Not only it makes you want to go back to the restaurant an endless amount of times, but it also educates your palate in a way you plan to replicate those dishes with nearly perfect execution.  That is exactly how I am feeling during these few bites of software engineering as it comes to an end, which I do not want to happen at all.  And I hopefully will not let it end since I enjoyed it!

When I registered for this class, I genuinely had no idea what I was learning during these harsh times courtesy of the COVID pandemic.  However, as the semester progressed, it started to grow on me just like how a person can have an anathema with stinky cheese, but eventually like it.  From the ever so (formerly) daunting Thursday WODs to the intense group final project, you can say I had an exhilarating trip to Software Engineering Flavortown.  On that trip, I am giving you a tour on some of my favorite topics we have discussed.
