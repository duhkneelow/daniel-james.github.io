A few weeks ago, I attended a bWOD conducted by our awesome teaching assistant Branden and our practice involved implementing code purely of HTML and CSS.  When I was attempting to replicate the images provided in the bWOD, I kept scratching my head in confusion and was wondering to myself, "Why is it not responsive?  Why is the sidebar overlapping the main area of the website?".  Fortunately enough, with Branden's advice, I was actually doing mostly everything right all along as it is difficult to create a functionally responsive webpage with only HTML and CSS.

A week later, we were all introduced to the world of Semantic UI via [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and it was definitely an insightful and informational experience to comprehend every single element along with its type, content, state, and/or variation.  Considering the fact it is my first time I have utilized Semantic UI, I can truthfully say I am enjoying every single moment of it and I definitely believe it is an effectively skillful asset for software engineers since there is an abundance of layouts for components, it is very easy to use when creating a webpage, and most importantly (in my opinion), it helps with your English/grammar skills.

## Elements, Collections, and Views... Oh My!!
For those of you who are not familiar with Semantic UI, it is basically a framework designed for you to create astonishing responsive layouts utilizing HTML and CSS.
