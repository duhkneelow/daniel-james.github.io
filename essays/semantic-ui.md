A few weeks ago, I attended a bWOD conducted by our awesome teaching assistant Branden and our practice involved implementing code purely of HTML and CSS.  When I was attempting to replicate the images provided in the bWOD, I kept scratching my head in confusion and was wondering to myself, "Why is it not responsive?  Why is the sidebar overlapping the main area of the website?".  Fortunately enough, with Branden's advice, I was actually doing mostly everything right all along as it is difficult to create a functionally responsive webpage with only HTML and CSS.

A week later, we were all introduced to the world of Semantic UI via [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and it was definitely an insightful and informational experience to comprehend every single element along with its type, content, state, and/or variation.  Considering the fact it is my first time I have utilized Semantic UI, I can truthfully say I am enjoying every single moment of it and I definitely believe it is an effectively skillful asset for software engineers since there is an abundance of layouts for components, it is very easy to use when creating a webpage, and most importantly (in my opinion), it helps with your English/grammar skills.

## Elements, Collections, and Views... Oh My!!
For those of you who are unfamiliar with Semantic UI, it is basically a framework designed for you to create astonishing responsive layouts utilizing HTML and CSS.  When I was listening to the PluralsSight videos, I knew it would be overwhelming to grasp every piece of information within a short period of time, but I was excited to learn something new and hopefully implement as much as I learned from those videos with incoming projects not only for this class, but also for other ICS classes.  From the variations of buttons to the content of items, the possibilities of making an awe-inspiring website for the user are definitely endless.  After watching/listening the PluralSight videos, I was pretty impressed with the code I created when I was doing the exercises throughout the week.

## Yes, Semantic UI Does Help with your Webpage
Since we have dabbled with Semantic UI for a week, I can once again officially state it has helped me create beautiful layouts within the exercises we have undergone as it honestly makes my life a lot easier compared to the times I fiddled around creating webpages with only HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for my past classes.  For example, the exercise that truly helped me the most was when we had to recreate a website we chose from the internet.  Although we were supposed to implement only the menu as well as a few sections while customizing the formats, I unintentionally decided to attempt to replicate every single component from the website I chose.  So, apparently, I put way too much effort on it, but I am also OK with the effort/self-motivation I put to it (even though I do believe I still need to a bit more work on refining my Semantic UI skills) because, like I said from my JavaScript essay, practice makes progress.  Also, it has made me improve a bit on my grammar skills.

## Semantic UI and English/grammar
Now, some of you guys may be scratching your heads in confusion wondering, "How on earth does Semantic UI associate with English/grammar?".  According to a PluralSight video I watched, Semantic UI is a natural language where you have (a) part(s) of speech and the word order.  The best parts about it are you do not have to abbreviate anything and it is easy to detect the differences in your code (just get pass through the amount of div tags you put depending on the lines of code you have).

When I was little, I was definitely not the best when it comes to grammar classes as I would stare at my homework assignments for minutes or maybe hours trying to understand the question and I would end up getting frustrated to the point where I would start to cry.  Luckily, with Semantic UI, it at least helped me a bit with those skills (even though I still have more room to improve).  One of the best tips I can definitely give to anyone interested with Semantic UI is ask yourself what type of element (Ex: a grid) do you want to put in your webpage and how do you want it to look like (Ex: Do you want it to be a stackable grid where you want the user to see every piece of information a lot more clearly?).  Since you want it to be a stackable grid, also ask yourself, how many columns do you want in your grid since a grid has columns (Ex: 2, 3, 4, etc.).  Put it all together and you get this wonderful piece of code:
```
<div class="ui stackable four column grid">
    <div class="column">Text of your choice</div>
    <div class="column">Text of your choice</div>
    <div class="column">Text of your choice</div>
    <div class="column">Text of your choice</div>
</div>
```
So as you can see, it may not be as challenging as you think even for some individuals whose first language may not be English, you just have to think quickly on your feet to get that line of code.

## Conclusion
At the end of the day, it does not matter what background you have, Semantic UI is user-friendly for people worldwide.  Despite it being overwhelming for some people, just keep practicing until you feel comfortable with Semantic UI.  Do not get defeated with what you have right now.  Keep going, use the resource I mentioned, and motivate yourself with it because someday a user may like a webpage you created with that layout.  Another useful resource besides the PluralSight videos I recommend is this website briefly describing the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/kitchen-sink.html) elements.  In fact, you know what, stop what you are doing that is hindering your productivity because U and I should code right now!
