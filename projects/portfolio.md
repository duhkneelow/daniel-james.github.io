The portfolio that I made is a bunch of work that I made throughout my undergraduate years at Hawaii Pacific University.

In my portfolio, I created web design projects that range from a company creating ice cream straight from the farm to a tourism company providing hospitality for their trip to Myanmar.  I also provided graphic design work that will potentially captivate your company one day.  Aside from graphic and web work, I dabbled a bit with some photography and I hope one day I own a camera so that I can play around/be inspired with the objects I'm around.

Since this was over a year ago, I found it insightful, but with the software engineering class, I hope to improve myself and possess a lot more skills than what I honed during my undergraduate years.
